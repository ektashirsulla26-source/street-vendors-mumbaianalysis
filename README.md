# street-vendors-mumbaianalysis
- A comprehensive statistical study on socio-economic factors, migration patterns, and business sustainability of street vendors in Mumbai using Regression, Clustering, and Poisson Models.
- This research project analyzes the factors influencing the income of street vendors, the migration trends amongst the street vendors and business sustainability across Mumbaiâ€™s transport hubs.  
- Methods used include **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Multiple Linear Regression, K-Modes Clustering, and Poisson Regression**.
------------
- **Methodology**:
- Sampling: To ensure a comprehensive and representative dataset, this study employed a stratified sampling survey method that systematically captures the diversity of street vendors across Mumbai's urban geography and business categories.
- Stratified sampling of 400 street vendors across the Mumbai suburban railway network (Western, Central, Harbour, Trans-Harbour).  
- **Statistical Techniques**:
  - Descriptive Statistics & EDA  
  - Multiple Linear Regression (average income predictors)  
  - K-Modes Clustering (migration patterns)  
  - Poisson Regression (daily customer counts)
- **Tools Used**:
  - **R**: Regression models, Poisson analysis  
  - **Python**: K-Modes clustering, data preprocessing  
  - **Excel**: Data entry and cleaning  
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization

- Key Findings
1. **Income Predictors**  
   - Western region vendors earn significantly higher.  
   - Non-food vendors face drastically lower earnings compared to food vendors.
2. **Migration Patterns**  
   - **Economic Migrants**: Low-income, non-food sellers, long working hours.  
   - **Stable Vendors**: Non-migrants, small families, low but stable earnings.  
   - **Opportunity Seekers**: Migrants seeking higher customer flow, average income.
3. **Customer Flow**  
   - Full-day vendors attract significantly more customers.  
   - Half-day or quarter-day work reduces customer count.  
   - Product type influences trends slightly (food/juices attract more, clothes attract less).
